# Unity-mic-example
Example of how to capture and play the microphone input in Unity.  

Latency is around 200ms, but this can very depending on your hardware and Unity settings.
For a lower latency I would recommend using [Lasp](https://github.com/keijiro/Lasp).

It is also possible to do this not for a microphone, but also capture and playback the audio currently playing on the computer.
To do this setup your audio settings / card as [described here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/audiostream-an-audio-streaming-solution-for-all-and-everywhere.412029/page-3#post-3120495).

Useful for e.g. a music visualizer.
